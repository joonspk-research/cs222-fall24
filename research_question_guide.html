    <h2>Appendix: Developing a Research Question: Guidance for the Final Project</h2>
	<p>Your final project should revolve around a central research question. Here are some suggestions on how to develop a compelling question, with an emphasis on drawing from established social science literature.</p>

	<h3>1. Replicate a Famous Social Science Study</h3>
	<p>One approach is to replicate a well-known social science experiment using the generative agents from our class. This allows you to test classic theories or social dynamics in a new context. Examples of studies you could draw inspiration from include:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>The Milgram Experiment:</strong> Simulate how your classmates might respond to authority. How obedient are they in simulated settings?</li>
	    <li><strong>Asch Conformity Experiment:</strong> Test how classroom agents conform to group opinions when presented with obvious correct or incorrect choices.</li>
	    <li><strong>Public Goods Games:</strong> Investigate cooperative behavior by simulating economic decision-making games like the Public Goods Game or Prisoner’s Dilemma.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>2. Explore Group Dynamics</h3>
	<p>Use the generative agents to examine how small groups interact. For example, you could ask:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>How do agents collaborate on a group project or task?</li>
	    <li>What types of social roles (e.g., leaders, mediators, dissenters) emerge in group decision-making?</li>
	    <li>How do personality traits (e.g., introversion vs. extroversion) influence group dynamics or the outcomes of a collective task?</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>3. Investigate Attitudes and Opinion Formation</h3>
	<p>Design a simulation to explore how classroom agents form or change opinions over time. Some potential ideas include:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>How do agents respond to persuasive messages or social influence from peers?</li>
	    <li>What factors (e.g., political views, personality traits) drive polarization or consensus within a class discussion?</li>
	    <li>Can we observe any patterns of opinion clusters or “echo chambers” among agents?</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>4. Simulate Real-World Classroom Scenarios</h3>
	<p>Create a simulation that mirrors common classroom dynamics. Examples include:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>How do different teaching methods affect participation and learning among agents?</li>
	    <li>How do agents handle conflict resolution or negotiation during group work?</li>
	    <li>How might the class respond to hypothetical changes in grading or classroom rules?</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>5. Generate a New Hypothesis Based on Classroom Characteristics</h3>
	<p>Reflect on the unique makeup of your class. Are there trends or behaviors that seem specific to this group of students? Use those observations to form a research question. Ideas might include:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Are there patterns of interaction between agents based on shared traits (e.g., similar academic interests, backgrounds)?</li>
	    <li>How do different personality traits affect responses to hypothetical stressors (e.g., tight deadlines, complex group projects)?</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3>

	<h4>Identify a Known Social Science Study:</h4>
	<p>Start by reviewing classic studies in social sciences (psychology, sociology, economics). Choose a study you find interesting and consider how it could be replicated or adapted for your classroom agents.</p>

	<h4>Formulate a Hypothesis or Question:</h4>
	<p>Once you have a study or idea in mind, ask: “What would happen if this experiment were run using the personalities and dynamics of my classmates?”</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>If you’re replicating a famous study, your hypothesis could be that the agents will behave similarly to the original study’s participants, or you might predict different results due to unique class dynamics.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Design Your Simulation:</h4>
	<p>Think about how you can structure your simulation to answer your research question. What interactions, surveys, or tasks will the agents perform? How will you collect data from the simulation?</p>

	<h4>Consult Social Science Literature:</h4>
	<p>As you design your simulation, refer to relevant social science literature. This will help ground your question in theory and ensure your approach is methodologically sound.</p>

	<h3>Example Research Questions:</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Replicating a Public Goods Game:</strong> “How do my classmates' agents contribute to a collective resource when given an opportunity to either cooperate or free-ride on others’ contributions?”</li>
	    <li><strong>Group Decision-Making:</strong> “In a simulated group task, do agents with higher agreeableness traits emerge as leaders or mediators in resolving conflicts?”</li>
	    <li><strong>Opinion Formation:</strong> “How do agents with strong political views influence the opinions of more neutral agents in a class-wide discussion on a controversial topic?”</li>
	</ul>
